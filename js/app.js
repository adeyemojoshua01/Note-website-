  const mathContent = String.raw`An equation is a little like a balanced scale. Once you understand how to keep both sides equal, finding the unknown becomes a lot less mysterious.

## What is a linear equation?

A **linear equation** is a mathematical statement that says two expressions are equal. The variable has a power of one, and our job is to discover its value.

For example, in $2x + 3 = 11$, the letter $x$ stands for a number we do not know yet. The equals sign tells us that the left side and right side have the same value.

${FENCE}callout
type: note
title: A small symbol with a big job
Think of the equals sign as a promise: whatever happens, both sides must stay balanced.
${FENCE}

## The balance principle

Imagine a balance scale with the same weight on each side. If you add a weight to just one side, the scale tips. If you add the **same weight to both sides**, it stays balanced.

Equations follow exactly the same rule. You can add, subtract, multiply, or divide, as long as you do the same thing to both sides. (Just remember: never divide by zero.)

$$a = b \quad \Longrightarrow \quad a + c = b + c$$

We use **inverse operations** to undo what has happened to the variable:

- Addition is undone by subtraction.
- Subtraction is undone by addition.
- Multiplication is undone by division.
- Division is undone by multiplication.

## A worked example

Let's solve $2x + 3 = 11$. Our goal is to leave $x$ on its own.

${FENCE}steps
1. **Subtract 3 from both sides.** This undoes the addition: $2x + 3 - 3 = 11 - 3$, so $2x = 8$.
2. **Divide both sides by 2.** This undoes the multiplication: $x = 8 \div 2 = 4$.
3. **Check your answer.** Put $x = 4$ back into the original equation: $2(4) + 3 = 11$. Both sides match!
${FENCE}

${FENCE}math
\begin{aligned}
2x + 3 &= 11 \\
2x &= 8 \\
x &= 4
\end{aligned}
${FENCE}

${FENCE}callout
type: tip
title: Work backwards, one step at a time
Undo addition or subtraction first, then multiplication or division. Write down each step so you can follow your thinking.
${FENCE}

## Try it yourself

Now it's your turn. Use the balance principle and take it one step at a time.

${FENCE}quiz
question: What is the value of $x$ in $3x + 5 = 20$?
options:
  - $x = 3$
  - $x = 5$
  - $x = 8$
  - $x = 15$
answer: 2
explanation: Subtract 5 from both sides to get $3x = 15$. Then divide both sides by 3. That gives $x = 5$. You can check: $3(5) + 5 = 20$.
${FENCE}

## Take it with you

Solving an equation is not about guessing. It is about making small, logical moves that keep everything balanced.

1. Identify the operation you want to undo.
2. Apply its inverse to **both sides**.
3. Repeat until the variable is on its own.
4. Substitute your answer to check your work.

Try these on paper: $x + 7 = 12$, $4x = 28$, and $5x - 2 = 18$. The answers are $5$, $7$, and $4$ respectively.

You have the tools. All it takes now is a little practice.`;

  const scienceContent = String.raw`From the tallest tree to the smallest ant, every living thing is built from cells. Think of a cell as a tiny, busy world with everything it needs to keep life going.

## The smallest unit of life

A **cell** is the smallest unit that can carry out the processes of life. Some organisms, like bacteria, are made of just one cell. Others, including you, are made of trillions.

Cells take in nutrients, turn them into energy, respond to their surroundings, and make new cells. They are small, but they do a remarkable amount of work.

## A tour inside the cell

Every part of a cell has a particular job. These specialized structures are called **organelles**.

- The **cell membrane** controls what enters and leaves the cell.
- The **cytoplasm** is a jelly-like substance where many chemical reactions happen.
- The **nucleus** stores genetic information and directs the cell's activities.
- The **mitochondria** release energy from nutrients through respiration.

${FENCE}callout
type: tip
title: Think of a miniature city
The nucleus is city hall, the membrane is the city boundary, and the mitochondria are the power stations. Every part helps the whole city run.
${FENCE}

## Plant cells and animal cells

Plant and animal cells have a lot in common. Both have a nucleus, a cell membrane, cytoplasm, and mitochondria. Plant cells also have a few special features.

| Structure | Plant cells | Animal cells |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Cell membrane | Yes | Yes |
| Nucleus | Yes | Yes |
| Cell wall | Yes | No |
| Chloroplasts | In photosynthetic cells | No |
| Large permanent vacuole | Usually | No |

The **cell wall** provides strength and support. **Chloroplasts** capture sunlight to make food through photosynthesis. A **vacuole** stores cell sap and helps keep the plant firm.

## Check your understanding

${FENCE}quiz
question: Which organelle releases usable energy from nutrients?
options:
  - The nucleus
  - The cell membrane
  - The mitochondrion
  - The cell wall
answer: 3
explanation: Mitochondria release usable energy through cellular respiration. The nucleus stores genetic information, while the cell membrane controls what enters and leaves.
${FENCE}

## The bigger picture

Cells work together to build tissues, tissues build organs, and organs work together in systems. Every level depends on the one before it.

${FENCE}steps
1. **Cells** are the basic units of life.
2. **Tissues** are groups of similar cells working together.
3. **Organs** bring different tissues together for a larger job.
4. **Organ systems** coordinate several organs, such as the heart and blood vessels.

  const writingContent = `A good paragraph is a little journey. It introduces an idea, gives the reader something to think about, and leaves them ready for what comes next.

## One paragraph, one idea

The strongest paragraphs have a clear focus. Before you write, ask yourself: **What is the one thing I want my reader to understand?**

This focus becomes your topic sentence. The sentences that follow should develop, support, or illustrate that central idea.

## Build a strong foundation

${FENCE}steps
1. **Introduce the idea.** Start with a clear topic sentence that tells the reader what the paragraph is about.
2. **Add evidence.** Include a fact, example, or observation that supports your idea.
3. **Explain the connection.** Show how your evidence supports the point. Do not make your reader guess.
4. **Bring it together.** Finish with a sentence that reinforces your idea or leads naturally to the next one.
${FENCE}

## See it in action

> Reading a little every day can change the way we see the world. A novel, for example, lets us experience life through another person's eyes. By following a character's choices and challenges, we develop empathy for experiences different from our own. Even ten minutes with a book can open a door to a new perspective.

Notice how every sentence connects to the same idea: daily reading builds perspective. Nothing distracts us from the point.

${FENCE}callout
type: tip
title: Read it out loud
If you stumble over a sentence, your reader might too. Reading your paragraph aloud helps you notice awkward phrasing and missing connections.
${FENCE}

## Your turn

Write a paragraph about a place that matters to you. Choose one idea about that place: its atmosphere, a memory, or how it makes you feel.

- Give your paragraph a clear topic sentence.
- Include two specific details.
- Explain why those details matter.
- Finish with a thought that stays with the reader.

## A final check

Before you finish, check that every sentence earns its place. If a sentence does not support the main idea, save it for another paragraph.

Good writing is not about using the biggest words. It is about helping someone else see what you see.`;

Gases spread to fill their container.','Heating transfers energy to particles. They move more vigorously and may overcome the forces that hold them close together, causing a change of state.'],
    'science-atoms':['Small building blocks','Atoms contain a nucleus of protons and neutrons, with electrons around it. The number of protons identifies the element.','A neutral carbon atom has six protons and six electrons. Isotopes of carbon have the same number of protons but different numbers of neutrons.'],
    'science-energy':['Energy changes form','Energy can be transferred between objects and transformed between stores. It is conserved: the total amount stays the same in a closed system.','A falling ball transfers energy from its gravitational store to its kinetic store. When it lands, energy is transferred to the surroundings by sound and heating.'],
    'english-voice':['Sound like yourself','A writer\'s voice is the distinctive combination of word choice, rhythm, and perspective that makes writing feel personal.','Describe the same rainy morning in two ways: as someone excited for an adventure, then as someone reluctant to leave home. Notice how perspective changes the language.'],
    'english-argument':['A claim worth supporting','An argument starts with a clear claim. Evidence supports the claim, and reasoning explains why the evidence matters.','If your claim is that a school should create a garden, support it with evidence about learning opportunities or biodiversity. Consider a reasonable objection and respond to it fairly.'],
    'english-reading':['Notice the small choices','Close reading means examining the details of a text: its words, images, structure, and tone. Ask how each choice contributes to meaning.','Read a short passage twice. First identify its general meaning. Then underline three interesting word choices and explain the effect of each.'],
    'english-character':['People on the page','Writers reveal character through actions, dialogue, thoughts, appearance, and the reactions of others. A convincing interpretation uses evidence from the text.','A character who shares their last piece of bread may be generous, desperate to connect, or following a custom. Look at the surrounding details before deciding.'],
    'english-poetry':['Meaning beyond the literal','Poetry uses sound, imagery, and structure to make language do more. A metaphor describes one thing as another to reveal a connection.','The phrase "the city is a restless sea" connects movement and noise with waves. Explain the impression it creates rather than simply naming the technique.'],
    'social-maps':['A different way to see a place','Maps represent real places using symbols, scale, and direction. Every map selects some information and leaves other information out.','Start with the title and key. Use the scale to estimate distance, then check the compass direction. Ask whether the map is designed for navigation, population, or another purpose.'],
    'social-communities':['Places shaped by people','Communities grow where people find resources, opportunities, and connections. Water supplies, transport routes, and employment influence where settlements develop.','Compare a town near a river with a town at a railway junction. Both may grow because they connect people and resources, but their challenges can differ.'],
    'social-resources':['What we need and how we use it','Natural resources include water, soil, forests, minerals, and energy sources. Renewable resources can replenish, but they still need careful management.','A forest can regrow if trees are harvested at a sustainable rate. If harvesting is faster than regrowth, the forest cannot recover.'],
    'social-sources':['Evidence from the past','Primary sources come from the period being studied. Secondary sources interpret the past using evidence. Both require careful questioning.','For any source, ask who made it, when, for whom, and why. A diary offers a personal perspective, but it does not represent everyone\'s experience.'],
    'social-civilizations':['Building complex societies','Early civilizations often developed near rivers, where fertile land and reliable water supported farming. Food surpluses allowed people to specialize in other work.','Compare the roles of farmers, craftspeople, traders, and administrators. Their interdependence helped settlements become increasingly complex.'],
    'social-trade':['Exchange and connection','Trade moves goods, services, and ideas between communities. People trade because resources and skills are unevenly distributed.','A region that grows grain may exchange it for tools made elsewhere. Along these routes, technologies, languages, and cultural practices can spread too.'],
    'cs-thinking':['From a problem to a process','Computational thinking is a way to solve problems systematically. It includes decomposition, pattern recognition, abstraction, and algorithm design.','To plan a class trip, break the task into transport, budget, timing, and permissions. Solve each part, then bring the solutions together.'],
    'cs-algorithms':['Instructions that make sense','An algorithm is an ordered set of clear instructions for completing a task. A useful algorithm is precise enough for someone else to follow.','A recipe is an everyday algorithm. "Cook until ready" is ambiguous; "bake for 20 minutes at 180 degrees Celsius" is more precise.'],
    'cs-decomposition':['Make a big problem smaller','Decomposition means breaking a complex task into smaller, more manageable parts. Each part can be developed and tested separately.','A quiz app can be divided into displaying questions, accepting answers, checking correctness, and showing a score. Define how the parts share information.'],
    'cs-variables':['A name for a value','A variable associates a name with a value. A descriptive name helps readers understand what information the program stores.','In JavaScript, `let score = 0;` creates a variable. Later, `score = score + 1;` updates it. Choose names like `studentName` rather than an unexplained `x`.'],
    'cs-conditions':['Choose what happens next','A conditional runs different instructions depending on whether a test is true or false. It lets a program respond to information.','For a passing threshold of 50, the condition `score >= 50` includes a score of exactly 50. Test values below, at, and above the boundary.'],
    'cs-loops':['Repeat without repeating yourself','A loop repeats a set of instructions. Some loops repeat a fixed number of times; others continue while a condition is true.','A loop that visits each item in a shopping list can calculate a total. Make sure its stopping condition can be reached, or it may run forever.']
